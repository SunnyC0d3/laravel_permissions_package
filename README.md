# Laravel Permissions Package

This package provides access control on a basic level. Designed to control what users can visit or access on a web page.

It was a way of playing around with learning to create Laravel packages and understanding polymorphic relationships within Laravel.

## Disclaimer

Some of the models you will see within the Models folder, were extra features that were going to be added onto the package but are currently not being worked on.
These include: Fields, Restricted Data.

Permissions access control is a fully working feature, whereas Roles is not entirely complete although the class does perform initial CRUD operations but what it doesn't do
is check for whether the user has Role access control.

## Installation

To try out the package, simply just download it and try it out via adding it to Packagist and configuring your composer.json to require this package, which will install it in the vendors folder.
Otherwise, you can simply just download the folder and manually play around with the files individually.
